\section{Experiments}
Before the above described crawler setup was run on the Google Cloud Plattform, multiple test runs to iterate and improve the code and the process have been conducted on the author's own machine, a MacBook Pro 2018 with 2.9 GHz Intel Core i9 Processor and 32 GB of RAM memory. Also, the steps for data preprocessing and data analysis were piloted on the data set of the UK.

    \textbf{Is that enough for the Experiments part? Or should I just leave that section out and put the information about pilots and tests at the end of the Data Analysis section?}

Talk about 
- how many pages the algorithm returned etc. (bring up stats from the log files)
- how many got cleaned away by applying the dictionary 
- % descriptive statistics
    % how many pages retrieved from which country / level (how many errors / etc. pp.)
    % how many were false positives
    % etc.
