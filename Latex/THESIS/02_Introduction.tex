%2. Introduction: Explains the problem; why it’s difficult, interesting, or important; how and why current methods fail/succeed at the problem, and explains key ideas of your approach and results. Roughly the same material as the abstract but with more space for motivation, detail, and references to existing work, and aims to capture the reader’s interest.


%Mergel Defining Digital Transformation: Digital transformation approaches outside the public sector are changing citizens' expectations of public administrations' need to de- liver high-value, real-time digital services. Triggered by supranational agreements, such as the “Tallinn Declaration on eGovernment” (European Commission, 2017), governments are changing their mode of operation in order to improve service delivery, be more efficient and effective in their designs, and achieve objectives such as increased transparency, interoperability, and citizen satisfaction.



%Mergel Digital Transformation: %We believe that additional research is necessary to distinguish digital transformation approaches in practice as they relate to their digital agendas. This well help identify how digital transformation differs based on the size of the country, its history, and present context as well as how these dimensions might have an impact on their digital trans- formation efforts.
%It might also be useful to break down the definitions by type of public sector services and its subsectors: We suggest that there are likely differences across sectors, such as health, traffic, safety, or social ser- vices. There might be sectors that are more prone to engage in the use of new technologies based on the types of public servants they hire. For example, national security might hire more engineers with a different type of education in technology than social services. We might see a more nuanced definition of digital transformation as a result of this distinction and the heterogeneous nature of the public sector itself.

\section{Introduction}

%why Britain and Germany?

%UK has been on the forefront of adopting agile in government 
%Cite Mergel 2016
%Similar to the UK and soon the Italian government (Amazon.com, 2016; UK.gov, 2016), the U.S. federal government as explicitly adopted an agile government approach in 2012 (The White House, 2012b, 2011). 

%Mergel
%A quiet government transformation is already underway with practitioners who are investing heavily in working in agile environments and applying agile approaches from software development to other types of government problems. Traditionally, major changes in the way government works are either introduced through policy changes or public management reforms. Agencies are now changing their project management techniques and even procurement practices, incorporating new values and methods that are foreign to classical “bureaucratic” organizations. 
%--> Government agencies are creating policies for agile government and introducing new practices and playbooks (e.g., U.S. GAO 2012, HUD 2018). For instance, digital service teams such as the United States Digital Service, the United Kingdom’s Government Digital Service, and the Canadian Digital Service have paved the way for working in an “agile way (Mergel (2020))







%what is my research question

%RQ1: What is the evolution and spread of agile governance methods and principles in the German and British public administration?


%MENTION: That strictly speaking gov.scot (Scotland) and gov.wales (wales) gov.ie (ireland) are also all part of uk but due to efficiency reasons this paper focuses on what is to be found on gov.uk 


% why only the top level institutions?
% since they take the leading role in government and are supposedely the ones driving change?

%This research paper thus aims to answer the following research question to help close this research gap: 
%\begin{addmargin}[2em]{2em}% 1em left, 2em right
%\textbf{RQ:}\textit{What is the evolution and spread of agile governance methods and principles in the British and German government institutions?}\label{RQ1}
%\end{addmargin}\par 


%Moreover, the canonical public administration literature has largely neglected agile and more fundamental changes it introduces to hierarchical and bureaucratic organizations. For instance, our search in Web of Science for the topic “agile” revealed that 26 research articles in “public administration”, most not related to the agile concept. Mergel2020

%Doktor: To answer these questions we apply a theory of gradual institutional change. (Greve2019)
