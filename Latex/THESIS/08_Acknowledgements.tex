\noindent I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation to my supervisor, Prof. Slava Jankin Mikhaylov, PhD, who supported me in word and deed during the entire thesis project. Also, I warmly thank my colloquium peers Sören Borghardt, Huy Dang, Anna Dietrich, Allison Koh, Yuan Ting Lee, Alexandra Magaard, Maximilian Rekuts, and Ole Teutloff for their valuable feedback as well as for the interesting and entertaining discussions during our sessions. Furthermore, I wish to give special thanks to Hari Krishna Vetharenian for consulting me on python programming and web scraping, and Henriette Kupi for proofreading the manuscript. Finally, I would like to express my extraordinary thanks to Ines Rieger for her academic as well as emotional support.
