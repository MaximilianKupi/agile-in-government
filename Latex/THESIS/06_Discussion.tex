\subsection{Summary of Findings}
This paper examined the evolution and spread of agile governance methods and principles in British and German government institutions. To do so, the crawling results from government websites – in particular cabinet and ministry pages – have been analysed for the appearance of agile terms as well as other topic relevant co-search terms.\footnote{The average number of co-search terms gives an indication of how in-depth the topic is being discussed on the respective sites.} Drawing on the results from Section~\ref{Analysis}, the major findings on a general level as well as with respect to an intra- and inter-country comparison are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:Summary of findings}.

The results can be read as sign for the increasing importance that agile methods hold for government institutions in the face of the digital transformation. Furthermore, they reveal the strong agile leadership position that British government institutions – in particular the ministerial organisations – have compared to Germany. Also, the results highlight the important role which the Cabinet Office as well as Government Digital Service, as the centre of excellence for the British government's digital transformation, came to play in that respect. Finally, the less substantial differences between central and non-central government institutions in the case of Germany potentially hint at a somewhat federalistic approach – in line with the country's state systems \parencite{Elazar1997} and as opposed to Britain's more centralistic approach – to bringing agile methodologies into government. 

In addition to uncovering above findings, this work contributes to the literature by exemplifying how a 'webometrical' analysis approach \parencite{Thelwall2009} based on self-crawled web content can yield substantive insights for public management research. 

\subsection{Policy Implications}
The policy implications of this work can be distinguished between implications addressing British government officials, implications for German government officials, and implications addressing officials of both and potentially also further countries.

For British Government officials the implications are rather complimentary. Their work, in particular the continuously persistent work of the Cabinet Office and Government Digital Service, appears to have paid off. According to the respective web publications, agile methods are spreading amongst a wide range of government institutions with their understanding of the methodology's particularities seeming rather substantial. Consequently, British government officials should keep up this spirit in order to truly and fully become an agile, digitally transformed government.

To German government officials, on the other hand, one would like to reply: "You are late for the agile party and also dressed rather unusually". To catch up, they could possibly adopt some of the strategies of their British colleagues: First, a clear acknowledgement that the digital transformation of government needs agile methods would set the necessary stage for public administrations to become active. Perhaps they could do this by making the link between agile methods and digital transformation much clearer in their strategy papers on the topic (see Section~\ref{Digital Transformation}). Second, they might consider having more distinct lighthouse institutions that push the application of agile methods and talk about it offensively so that other institutions take notice. Although the German Federal Ministry of Labour \& Social Affairs seems to have opted for this position recently, a clearer lead from the top, i.e. the Federal Government Office, might turn out to be more impactful.\footnote{The latest efforts of the Federal Government Office (i.e. \href{https://tech.4germany.org/}{Tech} and \href{https://work.4germany.org/}{Work 4 Germany}) are a good start but seem rather lukewarm and with limited radiant power.} Third, they could establish more government related online blogs, which would provide a low key communication channel where government officials could share their experiences and knowledge on the topic.\footnote{So far, blogs are treated rather poorly by German government officials in that respect: Only two of the crawler yielded agil* sites, as opposed to more then half of the British sites, originated from government blogs (\href{https://mb.sachsen-anhalt.de/start/blog-detailansicht/?cHash=76b9e1e8417e5e36ae5105ad14afa4f2&tx_t3extblog_blogsystem\%5Baction\%5D=show&tx_t3extblog_blogsystem\%5Bday\%5D=23&tx_t3extblog_blogsystem\%5Bmonth\%5D=06&tx_t3extblog_blogsystem\%5Bpost\%5D=267&tx_t3extblog_blogsystem\%5Byear\%5D=2018}{blog entry one} and \href{https://frauenseiten.bremen.de/blog/internationales-sommerstudium-informatica-feminale/}{blog entry two}, in addition both entries are only rather loosely related to government institutions).} Fourth and finally, Germany could consider adopting a similar "outside-in-approach" as Britain: Their digital, and therewith agile transformation apparently started with the implementation of the single government domain (gov.uk) by Government Digital Service (see Section~\ref{Analysis}). While this conversion potentially provided a much more efficient and effective way to reach out to citizens and fulfill their needs, it also made government institutions come into contact with Government Digital Service when transferring their web content to the new domain, and thereby might also have provided them with a first possibility to experience the advantages of using agile methods.\footnote{Interestingly, the most active German federal states in terms of number of agil* sites published and average number of co-search terms (Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, and Hesse) all have (mostly) single government domains (only two ministries from Baden-Wuerttemberg have their own domains).}

Finally, the policy implication for British as well as German government officials (and potentially also beyond) is that agile methods apparently have become a considerable tool for managing projects related to government's digital transformation. Hence, further experimenting and honest best practice sharing will be needed in order to fully reap the methodology's potential in better serving the citizen's needs with digital services. 

\subsection{Future Work}
%The limitations of the paper come with suggestions for future research. 
% brittain has a lot of content on blogs --> good outlet to discuss new developments?


% no webarchives in germany --> hence, probably lesser hits

% maybe brittain is more top down thus change from above while germany is more bottom up (change from below) --> need to check in future research

%limitations: 
%   no pdfs included in the search algorithm
%   checking each cleaning step and the whole error of all crawls (due to time limits not possible this time) 
% The seed URL for Britain was set to gov.uk, which basically includes the web presences of all British government institutions and agencies. However, for Germany, which does not have a single government domain, only the ministerial websites have been set as seed URLs, thus leading to an exclusion of potential subordinate authorities like the IT provider for the federal government, \href{https://www.itzbund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html}{ITZBund}. Expand the crawl also to subordinate authorities in germany



% potentially do a writers analysis to find out who has been writing those articles (is it only a hand full of people maybe?)


% cosearch terms not predefined but with an open approach (around a certain window around agile term) 


%Future Work Slava: interviews to dig deeper and understand why

%Future Work Slava: Include further online sources (blog of domenic cummings, social media accounts of big government officials etc.) to dig deeper and understand why

%limitations: craws yielded different results (i merged all of them however, in the future own crawler package, to know what exactly this thing is doing)

%fully automated duplicate elimination ?  --> collecting more features around the keayorwd from html document (is it in list/ etc.)

%developping quality principles for social science broad base / band webscraping (deterministic scraper, automated cleaning ect.) and how to achieve them 

%how to eliminate human selection bias (in determining seed urls / allowed domains etc

%how to use search engine results in scraping algorithm

%check reliability of results with data triangulation (?) additional interviews etc.
