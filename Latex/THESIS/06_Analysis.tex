First and foremost, it is to be noted, that the vast majority of sites mentioning agile working methods, also mention digitalisation / digital transformation (see Figure~\ref{fig:digital_percentage}). This is in line with the apparent connection between agile methods and the digital transformation of the public sector, as already discussed in the Section~\ref{Digital Transformation}.\par
As becomes apparent in Figure~\ref{fig:German levels over time}, German governments on federal and state level, have only started publishing agile related content in 2015. Furthermore, it can be seen, that federal level ministries by far, have been the most active in that respect (24 pages in total), and the first ones to publish agile related content in 2015.\par

When comparing the content published by the ministerial web domains of the federal states, it can be seen that Baden-Wuerttemberg's ministries have published the most number of websites referring to agile (12 pages), followed by Bavaria (8 pages), Bremen and Berlin (each 7 pages). However, in terms of how many co-search terms (for example 'scrum', 'sprint', 'design thinking'; see Table~\ref{tab:Co search terms} in \href{Appendix A}{Appendix A}) appear on average on those sites, Hamburg (7.7 co-search terms) clearly is a positive outlier amongst the federal states.
